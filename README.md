## Technical Details

This page was a one day project made due to me catching a serious **Star Wars** bug during the release of **The Rise of Skywalker** in December 2019.

This project was built with:
* HTML
* CSS
* Vanilla JS
* Loading Icon - [Loading.io](https://loading.io/css/)
* Parallax Stars - [CodeMyUI](https://codemyui.com/parallax-pixel-stars-using-pure-css/)

## Usage

To use the app, open `index.html` in your web-browser.

## Acknowledgements

Thank you to the developers that created the resources I used to implement this project!

### Spoilers
_This is not a real translator -- It is simply a "font switcher" with a fun star background! A super fun project nonetheless._
